		<h1>Introductory Statement</h1>
		<p>The food of the African Diaspora is the most triumphant exhibition of the relationship between imagination and despair I have witnessed. After being extracted from their land and stripped of their way of life, Africans -the commodities of the Columbian exchange- had to feed themselves with the food scraps of their masters. To the bewilderment of their oppressors, the leftover greens and butcher’s clippings were transformed into decadent feasts exclusively made for and by Black people. Even though these two concepts seem mismatched, the advent of “soul food” demonstrates how the processes of despair and imagination intersect and complement each other. When my ancestors received the discarded tails of oxen, their minds decoded and internalized the dehumanizing dimensions of the physical objects. Then -as a brutal act of retaliation or a natural yearning for excellence- my ancestors utilized their culinary skills to produce delicious and innovative meals. In this instance, despair was conceptualized in reality and then developed in the abstractness of the mind. Consequently, the feeling of despair led to imagination being propagated in the mind and then manifested into reality. In other words, I view despair and imagination as two different algorithms interacting with the same two data sets (the observable world and the intangible mind). When used together, despair and imagination create a cycle in which injustice is recognized and combated in ways that change humanity for the better. Although I cannot comprehend the immense pain internalized -or the intuitive genius possessed- by my ancestors, I know that the irresistible oxtail meal I enjoy today is the product of a rich intermingling of despair and imagination. </p>
