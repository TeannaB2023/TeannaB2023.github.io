	<h2 style= "text-align:center">Second Essay</h2>
	<p>
	I stood hundreds of feet away from Tyler the Creator as he tenderly played a rendition of his popular song “Earfquake.” Despite my shoes being submerged in inches of mud and the sweaty blond wig that laid on Tyler’s head, I felt as if I escaped with Tyler to a different reality. A reality in which everyone can express the full extent of their identity. A reality free from the judgments or assumptions of others. At that moment, my developing appreciation for his most recent album, Igor, crystallized into a deep understanding of its monumental importance as a conceptual and narrative piece of art. Tyler the Creator was able to distill and present his purest emotions with abandon. Additionally, as a recently open Black gay man, the bravery of the vulnerable presentation of his tumultuous love cannot be stressed enough. Tyler the Creator constructed the persona of Igor not as a crutch for his fragile ego but rather a shield from a destructive society that doesn’t validate the feelings of Black men, let alone queer Black men. After extensive research, I learned that the other-worldly theatrics and the raw emotional content of Igor was another masterful contribution to a tradition of Black queer male artists building safe places for emotional expression. Rather than letting their voice be overpowered by the world around them, these Black queer artists chose to augment the reality in which their art exists to promote an unchained expression of their identity. However this artistic choice just doesn’t empower the individual artist, it offers others the confidence to fully express their identities.

	The safe space that Tyler Creator curates is encapsulated the character of Igor. The dissimilar aesthetic of Igor disconnects his work from the very harmful consequences of the world he lives in. Although Igor is just Tyler in unusual outfits, the tone of the character is dissociated from the present culture that the artist exists in. Whether it is in a concert hall with thousands of fans or in a five-minute music video, Igor is unnaturally methodical. At times, Igor appears to constrain himself from expressing any visible emotion, then at the drop of a beat proceeds to rhythmically spasm in an explosion of emotion. In earlier albums such as Flower Boy, Tyler has coyly referenced his sexuality extreme timidness. This timidness completely disappears under the character of Igor. In the imaginative world in which Igor lives in, Tyler has the power to decide where the story starts and ends. Thus, the narrative themes of the album are explored on the pretense that the feelings of the Igor are valid, real, and do not need to be qualified with the detailed analysis of the character’s identity. As discussed in the article Post- Pomo Hip-Hop Homos: Hip-Hop Art, Gay Rappers, and Social Change, the Black, gay, male artists have strived to gain control of how they express their identity. The article argues that “ the construction of ‘whiteness’ and white privilege within LGBTQ communities…” and the “heterosexual privilege, which has defined homosexuality as pathological.” (Wilson 122). In the dominant culture, identifying as a homosexual is the unfortunate result of a confluence of external factors. Then, in the gay community, their identity and feelings as Black men are ridiculed by more privileged, White gay men. As an affront to dehumanizing popular beliefs, organizations such as the Black Gay Literary Movement of the 1980s established meeting spaces for Black gay male artists to share and develop ideas removed from the judgment of society. Whether building physical communities of support or cultivating fictional worlds with a colorful persona, Black gay male artists have and continue to change their surroundings to create a safe space to be who they.

	Like the Black Gay Literary Arts Movement, Tyler the Creator creates a world of his own. As a result, he is then able to successfully communicate complex and intimate emotions in his lyrics. In songs such as “A BOY IS A GUN,” Tyler can skillfully use language to express his emotions about his identity. He can proclaim his deep love by proclaiming, “Boy, you’re sweet as sugar,” while in the same breath realizing that his attraction is “diabetic to the first degree.” (Genius). The antithetical structure of his lyrics shows that, like any other relationship, Tyler experiences genuine passion but also genuine pain and hurt. Furthermore, by simply stating that his love is a “Boy,” Tyler makes his sexuality isn’t the essence of his experience of love (Genius). The person he loves is important not because of who they are, but what they mean to Tyler. Tyler is then able to explore the nuanced emotions this person makes him feel with beautifully succinct rap lyrics. In the poem, “at the down-low house party” Danez Smith demonstrates that Tyler the Creator isn’t the only Black queer male yearning to express a multitude of emotions. The poem imagines a group of closeted gay men building a safe space in their minds to express their complex emotions. For example, the line “we say wats good meaning i could love you until my jaw/ is but memory…” relays the disconnect these men had to undergo to express their complex and raw emotions (Smith 36). Smith’s poem highlights how there is a whole population of men just like Tyler the Creator who want to break free from the Black male constructs that have been placed on them by society. Furthermore, the feelings they want to express are more than straight-forward definitions of their identity. Similar to any other human being, they have complex and individual experiences of love, passion, or desire to articulate.

	When Frank Ocean, an extremely popular musician and close friend of Tyler the Creator, “wrote an open letter on his Tumblr blog in which he revealed that his first love had been a man.” many believed that our society progressed enough to accept Black gay men (Helligar). However, “For gay black male singers and rappers, outside the closet remains mostly a don’t-go-there zone.” (Helligar). Unfortunately, reality as we know it isn’t a safe space for the full expression of identities that aren’t heteronormative or whitewashed. For many of these artists, it became an uphill battle to transcend the assumptions the world had about them based on their identities. As a result, Black queer male artists continue to rely on themselves to create their world. In this augmented reality, they can communicate their life experiences without having to cater their message to the dominant culture. Their art doesn’t have to be burdened by the need to explain or justify their identity. In the space that their art exists --if only for a moment-- they can empower others to transcend their marginalized status in reality and have the privilege to discuss real and nuanced emotions.
