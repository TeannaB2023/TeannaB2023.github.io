		The text that has challenged and intrigued me the most was "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas” by Ursula LeGuin. At first, I thought that it was a simple story but then the symbolic imagery pushed me to seek deeper meanings in the words the author used. After my first reading, I decided to research the author to gain some context into what she was writing. With a simple search, I learned that LeGuin specializes in writing speculative fiction. I had never seen the genre of speculative fiction before, yet it perfectly described the mood of LeGuin’s story. Especially at the end of the story, the mood became very eerie and the content was disconnected from reality. I later learned that these stylistic choices are what define the genre of speculative fiction. Speculative fiction is a piece of work that establishes a world that is unlike reality and explores what could happen in this world. In other words, speculative fiction sets up an unreal scenario and asks what could happen. However, as I was reading LeGuin’s piece of work, its themes felt disturbingly topical and rooted in our reality. The idea that the unhindered happiness of the seen majority is reliant on the infinite despair of the unseen is heartbreaking. I became very angry while reading about the little child that was in the basement. I wondered how anyone could continue to be carefree and happy while they let a helpless child continue to suffer. However, I realized that our society employs the same cognitive dissonance to maintain the prosperity of capitalism. Whether it is the fast fashion industry, the mining of silicon that goes in our phones, or the stressful demands of the service industry, my lifestyle is also benefited by the pain of others.
