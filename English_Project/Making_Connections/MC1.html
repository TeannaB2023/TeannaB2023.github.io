		Although the text was an intense time commitment, I’m glad I read Nikole Hannah-Jones’ essay, “Our democracy’s founding ideals were false...” Afterall our discussion of her essay encouraged me to listen to the accompanying podcast series, 1619. In the podcast, Hannah-Jones explored the central arguments of her original essay by engaging with experts in many respects. From a historian who specializes in analyzing the slave economy to her aunt who grew up in the town where Emmet Till was murdered, she used these experts to present the novel knowledge about the legacy of slavery. Upon engaging with the multimedia project, my perspective was fortified with new and comprehensive information. I knew that slavery had negatively affected the lives of Black Americans well before the 1619 Project. However, when my White peers would skeptically question my beliefs, I would be at a loss for words. I observed the effects of institutionalized racism every day in my family, my friends, and on the news, yet it was difficult for me to communicate the pain of racism. To make matters worse, the belittling smirk my peers made as I stumbled over my words made me feel even more frustrated. Thus, the confidence in which Hannah-Jones delivered her arguments and subsequent information was inspiring. Furthermore, considering that the 1619 Project was purposely communicating to White Americans, her direct tone even more empowering. Going forward, the next time I return home and I am questioned about racism in America (and it is bound to happen) I can utilize the facts and tone of Hannah-Jones to get my ideas across to my audience.
