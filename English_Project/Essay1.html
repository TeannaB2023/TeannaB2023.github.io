	<h2 style= "text-align:center">First Essay</h2>
	<p>
		One evening, my mother casually strolled into the living room and stated that she would be losing her job as a Program Director of the Office of Minority Health Statistics and Engagement (OMHSE) in a couple of months. I was devastated. I was beginning my senior year of high school with dreams of attending university out of state. At that moment, I knew that I had to set aside my future aspirations because my family’s financial future couldn’t handle out-of-state bills. After fretting over myself, I looked at my mother. Behind her matter-of-fact demeanor, I viewed despair that not only encompassed her disappointment but the greater concerns I didn’t understand. Even though, my mother’s moment of struggle directly affected my financial livelihood, I wanted to learn more about the deeper implications that this moment had on my greater community. In my exploration of the defunding of the Office of Minority Health, I learned the power of examining how instances of individual despair can overlap and connect to build a network of people that can channel their shared despair into meaningful and passionate action.

		Before its defunding, the Office of Minority Health Statistics and Engagement was a small, state-funded agency established in 2010 and was tasked with tackling institutionalized racism(Lopez). Essentially, the employees of OMHSE analyzed Texas health data to identify substantial inequity in the health outcomes of different populations. Then with their findings and input from the affected community, the office launched a myriad of initiatives to remedy the health outcomes inequalities, all over Texas. As a young student who was just beginning to understand the intricate system of racism, I saw my mother as some sort of valiant social justice warrior. Every time she returned from a panelist discussion about institutionalized racism or a professional presentation about how racial bias affects the delivery of health services, I was amazed that she had the freedom to confront racial issues in the highest levels of our society. I was not the only person who recognized the accomplishments of OMHSE. A journalist from the local NPR station, Ashley Lopez, describes how the agency was able to address “higher rates of run-ins with Child Protective Services over alleged medical neglect issues” in communities of color “by talking to the community.” (Lopez). With this approach, the agency identified a lack of public transportation as the cause of the disproportionate outcomes and assisted in reforming the transportation services in the area. At first, the organization was praised for the straightforward results its radical approach produced. However, after several years, the “valiant warriors” I saw were viewed as ineffective trouble-makers by their superiors.

		Although the Texas State government only supported less than 20% of OMHSE’s budget, many Texas legislators became uncomfortable with the activities conducted by the agency (Eighty-fifth Texas Legislature, II-81). Lauren Lluveras -a former colleague of my mother’s- recalled Senate Finance Committee Chair Jane Nelson remarking that “she was unconvinced the program needed 26 staff members,” in 2016 (Lluveras). After years of leaving the agency to its tasks, the Texas government became very concerned with the image and perception of the Center for Elimination of Disproportionality and Disparities. Before my mother’s employment, the state agency was called Center for Elimination of Disproportionality and Disparities. Due to political scrutiny, the Texas legislature changed the agency’s title to the less threatening, Office of Minority Health Statistics and Engagement (Lopez). The seemingly insignificant name alteration signaled the beginning of a strained relationship between the Texas State legislature and the re-christened OMHSE; the General Appropriations Bill of the 85th Legislature was the final ultimatum. The only reason the organization was mentioned in the 2017 General Appropriations bill was to proclaim that OMHSE had exactly 2 years to transfer its functions to a public university, find funding from outside of the State government, or cease to exist.

		Although I was not keeping up with the appropriation news of the Texas legislature, I began to notice my mother returning home from work wearier and wearier, during this period. After offering an exhausting greeting and asking for someone to prepare her some tea, she then continued working -presumably to secure funding for the agency- in the home office for unreasonably long hours. Noticing her fatigue, I prepared her tea almost every night with the occasional plate of cheese and crackers. However, I was not perceptive enough to understand that my mother was mourning the life of her agency several months before it closed. Once August 31st, 2019 arrived the agency was still without substantial funding, and thus, the Office of Minority Health Statistics and Engagement was no more.

		In the subsequent months, the same mournful despair my mother quietly observed was now publicly demonstrated by the local media through opinion articles and fast-paced news reports. One article written by my mother’s former colleague, Lauren Lluveras, equated the defunding of OMHSE to a “broken promise” by the Legislature because they were supposed to “provide… better services” for all Texans (Lluveras). However, after learning about the agency, the individuals suffering as a result of the closing of the office are more specific than all Texans. On the other hand, I also don’t believe that my family or the families of the--other employees were the only ones directly affected by the government’s disinvestment. Rather, there were specific lives that were linked to the work of my mother’s former office: the communities that continue to experience disproportionate health outcomes in Texas. One of the most important communities affected is the Black mothers of Texas. Although I was not aware at the time, my mother participated in the Texas Morbidity and Mortality Task Force on behalf of her agency, in partnership with the University of Texas at Austin’s Institute for Urban Policy Research and Analysis. In that project she published a report on the State of Black Lives in Texas, in which a whole section was dedicated to representing the disturbing data on the mortality rate of Black mothers in Texas during and after delivery. Even after her employment expired, my mother joined the Black Mamas Community Collective, an independent organization that advocates for improving the experiences of Black mothers.
