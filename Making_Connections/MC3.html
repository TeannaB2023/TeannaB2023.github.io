		I have never been good at playing video games but I have always enjoyed watching others play videogames. Thus, our most recent class was really interesting to me. After our discussion of various videogames, I gained a better understanding of why I enjoy videogames. The design and structure of videogames were meant to build a reality that a player can get sucked into. Even in the older iterations, the story behind the gameplay was thoughtfully built and incorporated into the user experience. Originally, games would come with a small booklet that explained the backstory and all the characters in the game. This was done because developers werenâ€™t able to storyline data and the data required to run the game. Today videogames have plenty of room to hold as much information as developers wanted. But instead of making players read through pages of explanation, the game design tells the story with as much detail as the old-time booklets. For example, in the game Hollow Knight, the player learns more and more about the game world as they complete checkpoints and overcome obstacles. Even the design of the characters in the story, explain the themes of the game world. As a result, I became more interested in the playing game and experiencing the story the game developers created.
